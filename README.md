This is a cool application I developed demonstrating the fundamental Redux concepts. It is a cool app to see the strength of the superhero team you build. The app is a static one and is hosted on github pages.

## Live Demo
(http://madanaya.github.io/supersquad)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
